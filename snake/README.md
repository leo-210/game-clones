# Tetris Clone

This is a simple snake game made with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

It can be played on Android, Windows and Linux. 

## Controls

For now, you cannot change these controls.

### Touchscreen

Swipe in the direction you want to turn to. You do not need to release your finger to turn in another direction : you can turn multiple times in one swipe !

### Keyboard

- **Right / D** : move to the right
- **Left / A** : move to the left
- **Up / W** : move up
- **Down / S** : move down

*You do not need to change your keyboard layout in case you're not in QWERTY. For example, if you have the 
french layout AZERTY, instead of pressing the Z key, you should press the W key.*

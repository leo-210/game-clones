# Tetris Clone

This is a tetris clone made with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

It can be played on Android, Windows and Linux. 

## Controls

For now, you cannot change these controls.

### Touchscreen

Toggle the "Button controls" (toggled on by default on Android) before starting the game. Then just press the different buttons.

*I might add support for swiping and different button layouts*

### Keyboard

- **Left** and **Right** arrow keys : move horizontally.
- **Up** arrow key : hard drop *(locking, might change)*
- **Down** arrow key : soft drop *(non-locking)*.
- **X** : rotate clockwise.
- **Z** : rotate counterclockwise
- **Spacebar** : hold piece

*You do not need to change your keyboard layout in case you're not in QWERTY. For example, if you have the 
french layout AZERTY, instead of pressing the Z key, you should press the W key.*

### Controller

- **Left action** *(PlayStation : *O* / Xbox : *B*)* : move left.
- **Right action** *(PlayStation : *Square* / Xbox : *X*)* : move left.
- **Up action** *(PlayStation : *Triangle* / Xbox : *Y*)* : hard drop *(locking, might change)*
- **Down action** *(PlayStation : *X* / Xbox : *A*)* : soft drop *(non-locking)*.
- **Left stick left / Left arrow** : rotate clockwise.
- **Left stick right / Right arrow** : rotate counterclockwise
- **PlayStation : L1 / Xbox : LB** : hold piece

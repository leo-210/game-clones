# Tetris Clone

This is a tetris clone made with [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/).

It can be played on Android, Windows and Linux. 

## Controls

### Keyboard

- **Left** and **Right** arrow keys : move horizontally.
- **Up** arrow key : hard drop *(locking, might change)*
- **Down** arrow key : soft drop *(non-locking)*.
- **X** : rotate clockwise.
- **Z** : rotate counterclockwise
- **Spacebar** : hold piece

*You do not need to change your keyboard layout in case you're not in QWERTY. For example, if you have the 
french layout AZERTY, instead of pressing the Z key, you should press the W key.*


## Game assets
